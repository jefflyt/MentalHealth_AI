Panic Disorder and Panic Attacks

What is a Panic Attack?
A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes. It can occur unexpectedly or be triggered by specific situations. Panic attacks are not dangerous, but they can feel very frightening.

Common Symptoms of Panic Attacks:
- Rapid, pounding heart rate
- Sweating and trembling
- Shortness of breath or feeling of choking
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Nausea or stomach distress
- Feeling dizzy, lightheaded, or faint
- Chills or hot flashes
- Numbness or tingling sensations
- Feeling detached from reality (derealization)
- Fear of losing control or "going crazy"
- Fear of dying

What is Panic Disorder?
Panic disorder is diagnosed when someone experiences recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and develops persistent worry about having future attacks or changes their behavior to avoid attacks (such as avoiding certain places or situations).

Difference Between Panic Attack and Anxiety:
- Panic attacks come on suddenly and peak quickly (within 10 minutes)
- Anxiety builds gradually and can last for hours or days
- Panic attacks are more intense but shorter
- Anxiety may be tied to specific worries; panic attacks can occur "out of the blue"

Common Triggers:
- Stressful life events
- Major life transitions
- Caffeine, alcohol, or drug use
- Medical conditions (thyroid problems, heart conditions)
- Lack of sleep
- Specific phobias or situations
- Sometimes no identifiable trigger

Immediate Coping Strategies During a Panic Attack:
1. **Recognize it's a panic attack** - Remind yourself it will pass and you're not in danger
2. **Focus on breathing** - Slow, deep breaths (breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6)
3. **Ground yourself** - 5-4-3-2-1 technique (name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, etc.)
4. **Stay where you are** - Don't run away; this reinforces fear
5. **Use calming self-talk** - "This is temporary," "I am safe," "This will pass"

Long-Term Management:
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** - Highly effective for panic disorder
- **Medication** - Antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed
- **Regular exercise** - Reduces overall anxiety and stress
- **Stress management** - Meditation, yoga, relaxation techniques
- **Avoid triggers** - Limit caffeine, alcohol, and get adequate sleep
- **Support groups** - Connect with others who understand

When to Seek Professional Help:
- Panic attacks are frequent or interfering with daily life
- You're avoiding situations due to fear of panic attacks
- You develop depression or other mental health concerns
- You're using alcohol or drugs to cope
- Physical symptoms are affecting your health
