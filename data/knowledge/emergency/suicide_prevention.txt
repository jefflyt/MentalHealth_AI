## 🆘 How to Help Someone Who Is Suicidal

### Immediate Steps

#### 1. Take It Seriously
- **Never dismiss** suicidal statements as attention-seeking
- **Trust your instincts** - if you're worried, take action
- **Don't promise secrecy** - their safety is more important

#### 2. Listen Without Judgment
- **Give them your full attention**
- **Don't try to solve their problems** immediately
- **Avoid saying** "things could be worse" or "think positive"
- **Do say** "I'm here for you" and "Your life matters to me"

#### 3. Ask Direct Questions
- **"Are you thinking about suicide?"**
- **"Do you have a plan?"**
- **"Do you have access to means?"**
- **"When are you thinking of doing this?"**

*Asking about suicide does NOT put the idea in their head or increase risk*

#### 4. Get Immediate Help
**If there's immediate danger:**
- **Call 995** (emergency services)
- **Call SOS: 1767** together
- **Go to IMH emergency** (6389-2222)

**If not immediate danger:**

- "You're not alone in this"
- "I care about you"
- "Let's get through this together"
