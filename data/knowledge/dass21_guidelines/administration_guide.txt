DASS-21 Administration and Interpretation Guidelines

The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) is a widely used clinical assessment tool for measuring emotional distress. This guide provides comprehensive information for proper administration and interpretation.

Overview of DASS-21:
- 21-item self-report questionnaire
- Measures three related emotional states: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress
- 7 items per subscale
- 4-point Likert scale (0-3)
- Timeframe: Past week
- Administration time: 5-10 minutes
- Suitable for ages 17+ (adolescent and adult populations)

Theoretical Foundation:
The DASS-21 is based on the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, which distinguishes between:
- Depression: Low positive affect, anhedonia, hopelessness
- Anxiety: Physiological arousal, situational anxiety, subjective fear
- Stress: Chronic non-specific arousal, tension, irritability

Administration Instructions:

Pre-Administration:
- Ensure quiet, private environment
- Explain the purpose and confidentiality of the assessment
- Emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers
- Encourage honest responses based on the past week

Standard Instructions to Client:
"Please read each statement and circle a number 0, 1, 2, or 3 which indicates how much the statement applied to you over the past week. There are no right or wrong answers. Do not spend too much time on any statement."

Response Scale:
0 = Did not apply to me at all
1 = Applied to me to some degree, or some of the time
2 = Applied to me a considerable degree, or a good part of the time
3 = Applied to me very much, or most of the time

DASS-21 Items by Subscale:

Depression Subscale (Items: 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, 21):
3. I couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all
5. I found it difficult to work up the initiative to do things
10. I felt that I had nothing to look forward to
13. I felt sad and depressed
16. I felt that I had lost interest in just about everything
17. I felt I wasn't worth much as a person
21. I felt that life wasn't worthwhile

Anxiety Subscale (Items: 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, 20):
2. I was aware of dryness of my mouth
4. I experienced breathing difficulty (e.g., excessively rapid breathing, breathlessness in the absence of physical exertion)
7. I had a feeling of shakiness (e.g., legs going to give way)
9. I found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended
15. I had a feeling of faintness
19. I was aware of the action of my heart in the absence of physical exertion (e.g., sense of heart rate increase, heart missing a beat)
20. I felt scared without any good reason

Stress Subscale (Items: 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 18):
1. I found myself getting upset by quite trivial things
6. I tended to over-react to situations
8. I felt that I was using a lot of nervous energy
11. I found myself getting upset rather easily
12. I felt that I was rather touchy
14. I was intolerant of anything that kept me from getting on with what I was doing
18. I felt that I was rather touchy

Scoring Procedures:

Step 1: Calculate Raw Scores
- Sum the scores for each subscale (7 items each)
- Possible range for each subscale: 0-21

Step 2: Multiply by 2
- Multiply each subscale score by 2 to match DASS-42 equivalents
- Final possible range for each subscale: 0-42

Example Calculation:
Depression items (3,5,10,13,16,17,21): 2+1+3+2+1+0+2 = 11
Depression score: 11 × 2 = 22

Interpretation Guidelines:

Depression Severity Levels:
- Normal: 0-9
- Mild: 10-13
- Moderate: 14-20
- Severe: 21-27
- Extremely Severe: 28+

Anxiety Severity Levels:
- Normal: 0-7
- Mild: 8-9
- Moderate: 10-14
- Severe: 15-19
- Extremely Severe: 20+

Stress Severity Levels:
- Normal: 0-14
- Mild: 15-18
- Moderate: 19-25
- Severe: 26-33
- Extremely Severe: 34+

Clinical Interpretation:

Normal Range:
- Scores within normal population parameters
- No significant symptoms of distress
- Routine monitoring may be appropriate

Mild Range:
- Slightly elevated symptoms
- May benefit from self-help strategies
- Monitor for progression
- Consider preventive interventions

Moderate Range:
- Clinically significant symptoms
- Professional consultation recommended
- May benefit from therapy or counseling
- Consider lifestyle interventions

Severe Range:
- Substantial symptoms affecting functioning
- Professional treatment strongly recommended
- May require intensive intervention
- Consider psychiatric evaluation

Extremely Severe Range:
- Very high levels of distress
- Immediate professional attention indicated
- May require crisis intervention
- Consider inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment

Special Considerations:

Cultural Factors:
- DASS-21 has been validated across diverse populations
- Consider cultural expressions of distress
- Some items may have different cultural interpretations
- Use culturally appropriate follow-up questions

Age Considerations:
- Validated for ages 17+
- Older adults may interpret some items differently
- Consider age-related health conditions that might affect responses
- Adolescents may need additional support understanding items

Comorbidity:
- High intercorrelation between subscales is common
- Many individuals score high on multiple subscales
- Consider overall pattern rather than isolated scores
- Assess for specific symptom clusters

Response Validity:
- Check for missing items (affects scoring)
- Look for response patterns (all same number)
- Consider social desirability bias
- Assess motivation and comprehension

Follow-up Recommendations by Score Range:

Normal Scores:
- Acknowledge current wellness
- Discuss preventive strategies
- Schedule routine check-ins if appropriate
- Provide psychoeducation about warning signs

Mild Scores:
- Explore recent stressors or changes
- Introduce stress management techniques
- Consider self-help resources
- Schedule follow-up in 2-4 weeks

Moderate Scores:
- Comprehensive assessment recommended
- Discuss treatment options
- Consider referral to mental health professional
- Implement immediate coping strategies

Severe Scores:
- Urgent professional consultation
- Safety assessment if depression scores high
- Consider immediate intervention
- Provide crisis resources

Extremely Severe Scores:
- Immediate professional attention required
- Comprehensive safety assessment
- Consider emergency services if necessary
- Intensive treatment planning

Documentation Requirements:
- Date and time of administration
- Raw scores for each subscale
- Multiplied scores (×2)
- Severity classifications
- Clinical observations
- Follow-up recommendations
- Safety considerations (if applicable)

Ethical Considerations:
- Obtain informed consent
- Explain limits of confidentiality
- Discuss results appropriately
- Provide appropriate referrals
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Follow crisis intervention protocols when needed

Re-administration Guidelines:
- Allow minimum 1 week between administrations
- Useful for tracking treatment progress
- Consider practice effects with frequent use
- Document changes over time
- Compare to baseline scores

Quality Assurance:
- Ensure complete responses
- Double-check scoring calculations
- Verify severity classifications
- Review clinical recommendations
- Maintain standardized procedures

Remember: The DASS-21 is a screening tool, not a diagnostic instrument. Scores should always be interpreted in the context of a comprehensive clinical assessment. High scores indicate need for further evaluation, not definitive diagnoses. Professional judgment should always guide clinical decision-making based on DASS-21 results.
