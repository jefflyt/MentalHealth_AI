# Panic Disorder - Complete Guide

- Often begins in late teens or early adulthood
- More common in women than men
- Highly treatable with proper care
- Can significantly impact quality of life if untreated

**Panic Attack vs Panic Disorder:**

## 🚫 Agoraphobia and Avoidance

### Understanding Agoraphobia
Agoraphobia often develops after panic attacks, involving fear of situations where escape might be difficult or help unavailable if a panic attack occurs.

### Common Avoided Situations
- **Transportation**: MRT, buses, taxis, airplanes
- **Enclosed spaces**: Elevators, theaters, small rooms
- **Crowded places**: Shopping malls, hawker centers, markets
- **Open spaces**: Large parking lots, bridges, parks
- **Being alone**: Away from home or safe person

### Singapore-Specific Avoidance Patterns
- **MRT avoidance**: Especially during peak hours or in tunnels
- **Shopping mall avoidance**: Crowded, enclosed environments
- **Work avoidance**: Fear of panic attacks during meetings or presentations
- **Social avoidance**: Declining invitations due to fear of panic
- **Independence loss**: Relying on others for transportation or errands

### Breaking the Avoidance Cycle

#### Gradual Exposure Plan
**Example: MRT avoidance**
1. **Week 1**: Look at MRT maps and photos online
2. **Week 2**: Drive/walk past MRT station
3. **Week 3**: Enter MRT station, don't travel
4. **Week 4**: Take one stop during off-peak hours
5. **Week 5**: Take two stops with support person
6. **Week 6**: Take longer journeys, eventually alone

**Key principles:**
- Start with easiest step
- Stay in situation until anxiety decreases by half
- Use coping strategies during exposure
- Gradually increase difficulty
- Practice regularly

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Impact on Relationships and Family

### How Panic Disorder Affects Relationships

- **Avoidance of work travel or meetings**
- **Reduced productivity during anxiety periods**

### Supporting Someone with Panic Disorder

#### For Family Members and Friends

**Do:**
- **Learn about panic disorder** - understand it's a real medical condition
- **Stay calm** during their panic attacks
- **Encourage treatment** - support their decision to seek help
- **Be patient** - recovery takes time
- **Maintain normal activities** - don't rearrange your whole life
- **Practice breathing exercises** with them when they're calm

**Don't:**
- **Tell them to "just relax"** - panic attacks aren't voluntary
- **Avoid all trigger situations** - this reinforces avoidance
- **Take on all responsibilities** - they need to maintain independence
- **Get frustrated** - remember they're not choosing to feel this way
- **Assume they're "faking it"** - panic attacks are very real

#### Supporting Recovery
- **Encourage gradual exposure** - celebrate small steps
- **Provide transportation initially** - but work toward independence
- **Learn their coping strategies** - help them practice when calm
- **Maintain social connections** - gently encourage social activities
- **Take care of yourself** - supporting someone with panic disorder can be stressful

### Singapore Family Considerations
- **Cultural understanding**: Help family understand panic disorder isn't weakness
- **Language barriers**: Ensure all family members understand the condition
- **Traditional beliefs**: Balance cultural approaches with modern treatment
- **Extended family**: Educate broader family network about panic disorder
- **Stigma management**: Address shame or embarrassment about mental health
