Scientific Evidence:

Remember: Exercise is a tool, not a cure. While it's incredibly beneficial for mental health, it should complement (not replace) professional treatment when needed. If you're struggling with your mental health, speak with a healthcare provider about a comprehensive treatment plan that may include exercise alongside other therapies.

The best exercise is the one you'll actually do. Start where you are, do what you can, and be patient with yourself.
