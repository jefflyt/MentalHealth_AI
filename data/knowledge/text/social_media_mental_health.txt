Social Media and Mental Health

The Impact of Social Media on Mental Well-Being:
Social media can be both beneficial and harmful to mental health. While it offers connection and community, excessive or problematic use can contribute to anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and sleep problems. Understanding how to use social media mindfully is crucial for maintaining good mental health.

Remember: Social Media is a Tool

Like any tool, social media can be used well or poorly. The goal isn't necessarily to quit completely (though breaks are healthy), but to develop a balanced, intentional relationship with it.

Ask yourself regularly:
- Is my social media use adding value to my life?
- How do I feel after spending time online?
- Am I connecting or just consuming?
- Is this time well spent?
- What might I be missing in real life?

Your mental health and real-life relationships matter more than any online metric. You have the power to control how you use social media - don't let it control you.
