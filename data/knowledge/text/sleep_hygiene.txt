Sleep Hygiene and Mental Health

The Connection Between Sleep and Mental Health:
Sleep and mental health are closely linked. Poor sleep can worsen mental health conditions, while mental health issues can disrupt sleep. Improving sleep hygiene can significantly benefit your emotional well-being, mood, and ability to cope with stress.

How Sleep Affects Mental Health:
- Regulates emotions and mood
- Improves concentration and decision-making
- Reduces anxiety and irritability
- Supports memory consolidation
- Helps process and manage stress
- Restores physical and mental energy
- Strengthens immune system

Recommended Sleep Duration:
- Adults (18-64 years): 7-9 hours per night
- Young adults (16-17 years): 8-10 hours per night
- Quality matters as much as quantity

Core Sleep Hygiene Principles:

1. **Consistent Sleep Schedule**
   - Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day
   - Yes, even on weekends!
   - Helps regulate your body's internal clock
   - Avoid sleeping in more than 1 hour on weekends

2. **Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment**
   - Keep bedroom cool (18-20°C is ideal)
   - Make it dark (blackout curtains, eye mask)
   - Reduce noise (earplugs, white noise machine)
   - Comfortable mattress and pillows
   - Reserve bed for sleep only (not work or TV)

3. **Develop a Relaxing Bedtime Routine (30-60 minutes before bed)**

7. **Manage Stress and Worry**
   - Set aside "worry time" earlier in the day
   - Write down concerns before bed (then set them aside)
   - Practice relaxation techniques
