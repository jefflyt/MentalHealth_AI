Tips for Parents:

If you're a parent concerned about your child's academic stress:
- Maintain open, non-judgmental communication
- Focus on effort and progress, not just results
- Avoid excessive comparisons with siblings or peers
- Recognize signs of stress early
- Validate their feelings
- Help them maintain balance
- Model healthy stress management
- Seek professional help if needed
- Remember: their mental health matters more than grades

Remember: Academic Success ≠ Life Success

- Many successful people didn't have perfect grades
- Different paths lead to success
- Mental health and well-being are more important
- Skills, character, and resilience matter more long-term
- There are multiple routes to your goals
- Your worth is not determined by academic performance

Singapore's education system is competitive, but your mental health is a priority. It's important to strive for your best, but not at the cost of your well-being. Balance, self-care, and asking for help when needed are signs of strength, not weakness.

If academic stress is affecting your daily life, please reach out for support. You don't have to face it alone.
